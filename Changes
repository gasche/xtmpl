Next release:
  - new parameter ~xml_atts for Xtmpl.string_of_{xml,xmls,xml_atts}
    to indicate whether or not to keep valid XML in attributes when
    printing an XML tree. Default is true, to be backward-compatible.
    When it is true, Xtmpl tries to unescape some entities. Only
    lt, gt, amp, quot and apos named entities are unescaped.
    When an entity is given by its character code, only the ones
    with code between 0 and 255 are unescaped.

Release 0.9:
  - Add Xtmpl.merge_cdata
  - Add Xtmpl.merge_cdata_list

Release 0.8:
  - API change: attributes are now associated to xml tree list instead
    of string, for performance reason
  - new "protect_" attribute, to remove from environment the rules
    in this attribute. For example: <foo protect_="title,id" ...>...</foo>
    will prevent applying <title> and <id> rules in the node's children.
  - the rewrite is now done as a fold, taking a data in parameter and
    returning it.
  - defer_ attribute is now handled only for nodes having a
    matching rule in the environment.

Release 0.7:
  - re-introduce (un)escaping ampersands in attributes, when
    the attribute name is specified in attribute escamp_

Release 0.6:
  - do not (un)escape ampersand in attributes
  - fix META version
  - generate and install .cmxs file

Release 0.5:
  - mod: do not use string representation to check for changes in
    fixpoint computation
  - API change: Xtmpl.E of tag * atts * subs
  - API change: No more Xtmpl.T constructor
  - API change: make API more homogeneous
  - API change: handle prefix in nodes and attributes

Release 0.4:
  - add: string_of_xmls

Release 0.3 (2012/08/30):
  * mod: "empty" env now contains the main_ tag remover
  * fix: all eval functions now remove the main_ tag (because
    all env now contains the binding to do so by default)

Release 0.2 (2012/08/28):

	* mod: env_of_list now fills the environment from left to right
	* add: new exception No_change for callbacks to indicate no change
